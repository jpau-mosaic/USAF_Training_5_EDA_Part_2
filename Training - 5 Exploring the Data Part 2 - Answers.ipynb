One thing that you will find in working with data is that there are a lot of ways that one can use the data you are working with. As an analyst, it is up to you to develop an understanding of the end goal of your analysis that can help you get more specific about your analysis questions and then figure out the best way to use the data sources available to answer those questions. This is often more difficult than the technical parts of the analysis.\n",
